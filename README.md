## ðŸš€ What is StudyHub?

Ever feel like your campus life is a chaotic mix of different apps and group chats? StudyHub is built to fix that.

### ðŸ¤¯ The Mess We're Solving
- **Information Overload:**  Notes are in one chat, event details are in another, and club updates are... somewhere else?
- **Missed Opportunities:**  It's impossible to keep track, so you miss out on study sessions, cool events, and important deadlines.
- **Difficult Connections:**  Finding classmates for a specific course feels like a random guess.

### âœ¨ The Solution We're Building
- **One Central Place:** StudyHub brings everything together. One app, one login, for your entire campus.
- **Supercharged Organization:** Our superpower is tagging. Every post is organized by **Course Code** (`CS101`) and **Category** (`Notes`), so you can find what you need in seconds.
- **A Community You Can Trust:** We verify every user with a university email, creating a safe and exclusive network for students.
